      <h2>The problem</h2>
      <p id="problem-statement">When I use Airbnb to find a place to stay in a foreign city, I try to find a place in the center of activity. The map allows me to get a general location of where my accommodation would be, but I wouldn't quite know what to do nearby.</p>

<p>Say I'd like to stay in Portland, Oregon. When I search for "Portland," Airbnb shows me Experiences, Homes, and Restaurants available in the city. But what if I want to know what's in the specific neighborhood I'm staying at? I can sort through Experiences one by one to see its location, but there should be an easier way to make my experience run smoother and lessen my trip-planning workload.</p>

    <h2>Solution and benefits</h2>
    <p>Instead of separating the two, Airbnb can integrate Experiences into Homes. By that, I mean including what Experiences are available near a specific listing. The simple exposure of Experiences within a listing allows the users to explore more than they originally anticipated, creating for a seamless integration. As a result, this helps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The user to make an informed decision about his or her stay.</li>
      <li>The renter to potentially boost their listing.</li>
      <li>The Experience hosts to promote their listings.</li>
      <li>Airbnb to increase its conversion rate.</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Placing the new feature</h2>
      <p>I propose the addition of <b>Experiences nearby</b>, similar to how Airbnb currently has "Similar homes," at the bottom of each listing. This section can be placed immediately above "Similar homes," since it is still relevant information that would guide potential guests.</p>
      <p>The photos within Experiences nearby listing should also be displayed in a carousel. Additionally, the photos should be portrait in order to differentiate between Homes and Experiences. The consistency would create a seamless transition and users would immediately feel familiar with the function. </p>

    <h2> Why this placement and not others?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Placing the section below the map in the middle of the listing?</b>
        <p>Doing so would disrupt the necessary information relevant to the home listing, similar to an invasive advertisement.</p></li>
      <li><b>Placing the section at the bottom of the listing?</b>
        <p>"Experiences nearby" is more relevant to the listing than "Similar homes.”</p></li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Display order</h2>
  <p>The order in which the recommended experiences are displayed can be organized by distance–closest to farthest. Perhaps this can be limited to around five miles.</p>
  <p>But maybe a listing does not have many Experiences in the area. Another idea is to look at a user's history, use an algorithm to determine relevant Experiences, and display nearby Experiences in the order in which they would be most interested. That way, the results would be even more tailored to the user's personal preferences.</p>

    <h2>Considerations</h2>
    <p>I did not integrate Restaurants into this project because Airbnb currently does not have a large selection of restaurants. Incorporating "Restaurants nearby" with few available would limit the effectiveness of the function. However, once Airbnb does expand Restaurants, I believe the function would work as well as "Experiences nearby."</p>
    <p>This project was done as a part of my KPCB design fellow 2018 application, which took me less than a week to complete. If I could spend more time on this project, I would definitely gather data through UX research in order to create more valid design solutions.</p>
