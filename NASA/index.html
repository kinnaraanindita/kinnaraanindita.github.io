        <h2>The Big Picture</h2>
        <p>The group in which I belonged performed various forms of testing to ensure that internal applications deployed by JPL functioned properly, but what they hadn't implemented was UX testing to ensure that the applications were efficient and intuitive. JPL deploys thousands of internal applications that employees use, most of which were designed by engineers instead of designers.</p>
        <p>Because the division I worked under was extremely technical, I was able to offer a fresh perspective as someone with a background in design and psychology. I was in a one-person UX team. As a result, I was responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li id="leading">Leading and establishing methodology procedures necessary for end-to-end UX research</li>
          <li id="bridging">Bridging the gap between engineering and design</li>

        <h2>Active Workspace</h2>
        <p>In order to establish a UX research methodology, I was assigned to work on a specific application called Active Workspace Client (AWC). AWC is a lifecycle management tool for flight projects used by engineers to have documents approved by supervisors. The application had 4000 active users at the time, many of which use the application on a daily basis. It was crucial that the application was easy to learn, straightforward, and efficient.</p>

          <h2>The Process</h2><br>
          <h3>Get to know Active Workspace Client</h3>
          <p>Before I could proceed and design a UX research methodology, I needed to learn the goals of AWC, its users, and its functionalities.<p>
          <br><img src="down.png" alt="arrow" width=20px><br><br>
          <h3>Create Usability Test plan</h3>
          <p>Here, I created a plan of action. I specified the objectives, the direction I would take, which participants to recruit, and some tools I would explore.</p>
          <br><img src="down.png" alt="arrow" width=20px><br><br>
          <h3>Heuristic evaluation</h3>
          <p>Because there wasn't any other UX expert around, I had someone very familiar with the application walk me through the process. He helped me assess problem areas using a set of usability categories.</p>
          <br><img src="down.png" alt="arrow" width=20px><br><br>
          <h3>Research survey methods</h3>
          <p>I researched various survey methods to see what would be the most appropriate for assessing internal applications used in a technical environment. I wanted to measure using both qualitative and quantitative metrics, so I considered what benchmark to use and how to measure them effectively.</p>
          <br><img src="down.png" alt="arrow" width=20px><br><br>
          <h3>Prepare guide for Usability Testing (UT)</h3>
          <p>Here, I created a loose script for Usability Tests to direct me what questions to ask and what I should be looking for.</p>
          <br><img src="down.png" alt="arrow" width=20px><br><br>
          <h3>Trial run / adjust methodology</h3>
          <p>Before I could begin conducting UT on participants, I went through a couple trial runs. This allowed me to adjust the methodology to ensure that the real thing would go smoothly and that I was receiving as much insight as I could. The trial run also helped me decide to conduct UT only on users who had no experience with AWC since I wanted to measure learnability.</p>
          <br><img src="down.png" alt="arrow" width=20px><br><br>
          <h3>Conduct UT, post-test questionnaire</h3>
          <p>I had five participants for the UT with varying ages and roles at JPL. I ultimately decided to give participants four tasks to complete with no interference, followed by a discussion and a post-test questionnaire.</p>
          <br><img src="down.png" alt="arrow" width=20px><br><br>
          <h3>Synthesize data + make recommendations</h3>
          <p>I collected qualitative data from observations and comments made during the UT, and quantitative data from completion rates, success rates, and post-test questionnaire (using the System Usability Scale). I created a log for each usability issue, and I made recommendations based on the findings.</p>

        <div class="context-right">
          <h2>Context and results</h2>
          <p>For context, I'll describe one task I assigned to the participants that garnered a lot of findings. This first task was simply to: create a document.</p>
          <p>You would guess that this was a simple task to achieve, but it was surprisingly the most difficult task for the participants. I witnessed a lot of frustration. The root of this frustration was due to the first input field that asked for an "ID," which gave participants no information as to what it referred to – JPL employee ID? Title of document? Any random string?</p>
          <p>When participants entered information within the input field that didn't match the correct ID format, a long error message would appear at the bottom of the page with other irrelevant information, and then disappear after 3 seconds. This error message only fueled the fire for the participants. So much so that on average, it took the participants more than 7 minutes to "complete" the task. "Complete" because it took them 7 minutes to give up on this first task.</p><br>
          <img id="awc-home" src="AWC-home.png" alt="AWC homepage" width=600px><br>
          <p>Turns out, the correct ID format was D-NNNNNN. So, "D-" followed by 6 digits. Not intuitive at all.</p>
          <div class="quantitative">
            <h3>Quantitative data</h3>
            <p>Average completion time for all 4 tasks: 9:41 min</p>
            <p>Average completion time for task #1: 7:22 min (76%)</p>
            <p>Success rate: 20% – 4/5 users could not proceed to task #2</p>
            <p>SUS score: 33.2 (according to industry standards, an okay score is about 68, a failing score is 51)</p>
          </div>
          <div class="qualitative">
            <h3>Qualitative data</h3>
            <p>Participants gave up after making multiple attempts at fixing their error as suggested by the error message</p>
            <p>“Well give me a list of the things I need to cancel out.”</p>
            <p>“There shouldn’t be any requirement for ID; you can have a basic template, but no specific string.”</p>

      <div class="box4">
        <div class="solutions">
          <h2>Solutions for task #1</h2>
          <p>Ideally, we could remove the ID field altogether and allow the system to generate a unique ID for the document once created in order to prevent the error from occurring at all.</p>
          <p>However, this may not be the most feasible task for the engineers as it involves changing the architecture of the system. So I also came up with quick and actionable solutions:</p>
          <p class="left"><span>01</span> &nbsp To use an example as a suggestion inside the field for users so users know what the field is asking for</p>
          <p class="left"><span>02</span> &nbsp To have one line of error message directly above the ID field</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="box3">
        <div class="next">
          <h2>Next steps</h2>
          <p>With the data I've gathered, the natural next step is to implement changes followed by A/B testing to measure the effectiveness of those changes. The methodology I used during my research was designed so that A/B testing can be done easily–through the use of a sample of new users, success rates, and completion rates.</p>
          <p>During my time at JPL, I also explored implementation of heat maps. By being able to visually see where users were clicking and scrolling, I thought that was a really insightful way to further see how users interact with an application. Although we weren't able to implement heat maps during my internship because of logistical reasons, my mentor is planning to push the idea forward.</p>

        <div class="lessons">
          <h2>Lessons</h2>
          <p>Prior to this internship, I worked within a team and had tasks assigned to me. So being in a one-person UX team at JPL taught me tremendously about managing myself and taking the initiative to get things done on my own. With little supervision, I was able to run an entire UX research from end-to-end.</p>
          <p>I also learned the importance of being able to communicate with engineers, product managers, and others who were in entirely different fields. Being the only designer in a technical division definitely pushed out of my comfort zone and forced me to learn how to present my knowledge in a way other people could relate. Meta-UX.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, I met a lot of amazing people at JPL. Never in a millions did I expect to work at NASA surrounded by aerospace engineers, planetary scientists, and other inspiring people so passionate about what they do. I never realized the importance of work culture until I got to JPL; to be surrounded by positive and open individuals and be in an incredible work environment where people care about one another.</p>
          <p>Thank you to my mentors, wonderful intern friends, and everyone who helped me along the way! <3</p><br>
